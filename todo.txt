- ~~create enemy movement (move towards player slower than the player can move)~~
- ~~create attack animations~~ TODO: make sprites all the same dimensions and scale collision so that you don't jump
                                around when turning around, and collision is still as expected mostly

- ~~allow enemies to be killed by attacks~~
- ~~allow enemies to damage player~~
- shrink sprites to reasonable size, adjust velocity as needed
- ~~spawn enemies continually in reasonable locations~~
- ensure there are graphical indicators indicating ~~health~~, score indicator, etc
- walking animations, other needed attack animations
STRETCH:
- add sound effects
- create a map that slowly shrinks over time, that kills the player if they fall
